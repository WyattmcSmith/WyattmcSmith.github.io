				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> Hello! My Name is Wyatt Smith. I am a Junior here at the Univeristy of South Carolina studying Biology and Chemistry. Outside of my academic life... which in all honesty takes up most of my life I love to be active. My mood is really based around my ability to complete a days work and then be able to get some sun. </p>

				<p id="1-2" class="hidden"> A little more about me. I am a Firefighter and EMT here in Columbia. I am stationed of Station 30, otherwise known as the "Dirty Thirty". Outside of my time in EMS I am a huge Rugby fan and use to play here at South Carolina until I had to make the decision between school and sports. I am a huge animal lover and have foster a lot of dogs and a few cats in my life. If I could choose the perfect pet for me it would be an Irish Wolfhound simply because it is bigger than me! </p>

				<h2> My Future Career Plans </h2>
				<p> Unforttunately my academic career will not stop with the completion of my undergraduate degree as I am hoping to pursue a career in medicine. Obviously looking at my resume in EMS becoming a ER Doctor is not too hard of a transition. However I hope for the ability to imerse my self into a specialty of medicine. Endocrinology, pulmonology, and cardiology are my top three, but to be completely honest... I will be thankful for any opportunity in medicine I am given. </p>

				<p id="2-2" class="hidden"> Outside of my medical school plans I do hope to continue to be able to volunteer as a Firefighter and EMT. I do love my current work but I do fear that I will develop burnout, it is very intense work and can take a lot out of a person. Outside of ER work the possibility of doing pediatric pulmonology is something that is very interesting to me. This is due to my struggles breathing as a young child and how eventually I was able to overcome them. Surgery is another possible route for me as many surgeons in my life have inspired me. </p>
